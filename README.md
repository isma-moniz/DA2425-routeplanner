# Route Planner

**This is a project being developed in the context of DA2425 - tp1 assignment**

## Objectives

The objective is to develop a path-planning tool supported by greedy algorithms that also emphasizes environmentally sustainable mobility alternatives.
It should identify the **fastest and second fastest** independent routes.
It should be able to plan routes that **exclude specific nodes or segments** (restricted routing).
It should be able to come up with environmentally friendly routes that **combine driving and walking with parking options**.
It should be able to deal with all sort of constraints, such as the **unavailability of certain routes**, or specific **mobility needs**.

## Notes
All cities are assumed to be two-way.
